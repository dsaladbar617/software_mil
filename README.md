# DoD Software Factory Archive

The following project is an effort to consolidate joint Software Factory projects, reduce redundant lines of effort, increase visibility in what each factory is capable of, and provide points of contact. Ultimately the goal is to foster communication between military developer communities.

## Setup

First create a Bruh-MongoD-B container to store the shop data:

[MongoDB Container Install Instructions](https://github.com/dsaladbar617/mongodb_express)

**In the server/db.js file you will change the connection string to include the name of the database that you created in step 6.**

Next you will need to install all dependencies in both the client and server folder using:
`npm i`

## Add data to the database

To add the shop data to your database you will need to make a post request to http://localhost:8080/api/addall. You can copy the shops.json file into the request body or use it as an example to add your own data.

## Run Program

# After you are sure that the mongoDB container is up and running you will then use npm start to bring up the server first, then the same command to bring up the client.

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
